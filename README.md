How do you use it? (Is there a "cheatsheet" you found or made that others can reference?)
What did you build?

## Overview
- In this morning's session, we'll explore the different technologies used, process/approach, unsolved problems and some wins and challenges that went along in creating my personal about me portfolio site.

## What problem does serverless solve?

#### Definition
Serverless is not really serverless...It is a way of programming that allows developers to run functions on a remote third party server.
This method is also known as Function as a Service where you are billed only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.

As per my research on how to deploy a node.js web app, it seems as if going serverless allows you to not worry about managing and provivisoning your servers which will save a lot of time in the end! 

- Advantages
	- Pros
		- no need to update operating systems of servers
		- no need to scale and provision servers
		- monitor servers for performance and availablity
    
 	- Cons
		- you have to give up your secret keys and credentials in order for Lambda to listen to your resources.
    - this is needed so lambda can grab pictures on S3 and run functions on your behalf
		- new technology so potential for bugs
    - installs alot of packages
    
    
## How did I use serverless?
  Created a simple api endpoint that returns a success message in JSON format.
  
#### Technologies used

  - Node.js
  - AWS account
  - Terminal
  
  -Youtube Tutorials

	Highlight section when user scrolls to the corresponding section of the page
	- Functions
		- `scrollspy()`â€¦only section of the site that uses bootstrap JavaScript file

		- Call a function scrollspy each time we scroll and target #nav-scroll |
		this is to highlight the current section

	 `$('body').scrollspy({ target: '#nav-scroll' })`


- Modal

	Completely bootstrap

	Modal appears when "About Me" button is clicked
	- Classes:
		- `.modal` (actual modal)
		- `.fade` (used as a transition effect, fade in the modal)
		- `.bd-example-modal-lg` (used for sizing, lg could be changed to sm)
		- `.modal-body`, `.modal-header`, `modal-title`, `modal-footer`

- Responsiveness

	Bootstrap made it easier to implement responsiveness across all devices but not all parts of the site rely on bootstrap for responsiveness

	- Responsive youtube videos
	- Classes:
		- `.embed-responsive`
		- `.col` (uses flex boxes, grow)


	Other bootstrap responsive use cases
	- Footer


#### JavaScript/jQuery
JS and jQuery were necessary to manipulate the DOM and specifically in these areas

- Skills animation ( can be found in the about me modal( the icons fading in and out effect))

	- Functions
			- `setInterval()`
			- `fadeout()`
			- `fadein()`

 - Carousel that displays recent projects at the top of the home page

 - `scrollspy()` mentioned above in the nav bar

	- Racer game

#### HTML/css
	Necessary Components in every website

	Design principles
	- Dim effect on the background to create a movie feel inspired by latest tools such as "Atom"
	- Royal gold secondary color to match the gold mockups
	- Em's and % used to scale paddings, margins and fonts
	- 1 main css file to reduce file dependency on the overall site
	- Overall, a minimalstic design with all the important content in the center


## Process/Approach:

#### Problem
	- Owner of a surplus of creative content but missing a professional online presence to exhibit their work to the public

 	- Lack full control of the front/back end of my sites due to utilizing wordpress

	- Project 0 For WDI required either an about me site or racer game

#### Solution
	- Create an eye catching portfolio site and update it as I go along the WDI course to showcase all the skills I will amass such as JavaScript and MERN stacks

	- Picked the about me option for Project 0

#### Project Role
  - I worked individually as a front ent web developer and designer

#### Duration
	- Still ongoing

#### Competitive Research

 Competitive analysis of 3 other visual artists and web developers in my network

		- https://www.psdnym.com/
		- https://www.patricianderson.com/
		- https://www.misslaurairene.com
		- All my fellow WDI classmates personal websites

 User Research (people who will be visiting my site)

		- Hiring Managers
		- Friends and Family
		- Personal clients
		- Prospect clients
		- Disabled users

 Other Steps
		- The base template I chose as a prototype was www.psdnym.com
		- I then conducted wire Frames based of that site and added some of my own features
		- Created a repo on GIT and started Semantic HTML to layout on page on Atom
		- Programmed top down so carausel -> navbar -> main content -> about me
		- Applied styling and placeholders as I went along
		- Last thing was making sure everything was responsive
